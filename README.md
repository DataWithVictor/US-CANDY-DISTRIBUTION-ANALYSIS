# QUESTIONS ANSWERED

1. What are the most efficient factory to customer shipping routes?

2. What about the least efficient?

3. Which product lines have the best product margin?

4. Which product lines should be moved to a different factory to optimize shipping routes? 

# RESULTS AND FINDING

1. The most efficient factory focusing on factory-to-customer logistics is Lot's O' Nuts, because they optimize cost, time, and profit, making it the most strategically efficient route.
   
2. Sugar Shack represents the least efficient route due to its costly shipping needs and low financial return, making it a not ideal focus focus for streamlined factory-to-customer logistics.

3. Wonka Bar-Scrumdiddlyumptious has the highest product margin among all product lines, indicating it generates the most profit per unit of sales. This makes it a key product for maximizing profitability     and strategic focus.

4. Kazookles, Hair Toffee, SweeTARTS, Fizzy Lifting Drinks, Laffy Taffy, Nerd and Fun Dip should be to a different factory to optimize shipping routes.
   
# RECOMMENDATIONS
- Move product lines currently handled by Sugar Shack and The Other Factory to Secret Factory. Secret Factory has demonstrated higher efficiency and cost effectiveness with similar division or product        types, especially those involving suger and others products. This shift is expected to reduce shipping costs, improve delivery, reliability, and increase overrall profit margins.
- Sugar Shack and The Other Factory should study and adopt the operational strategies of Secret Factory. Secret Factory consistently demonstrates higher efficiency, lower shipping costs, and better profit
margins on similar product lines. By learning from Secret Factory's logistics and production model, both factories can significantly improve their performance and contribute more effectively to the overall supply chain efficiency.
